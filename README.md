🚀 **Web Scraping with Python – Extracting Product Data!** 🛍️📊 

I recently worked on a **web scraping project** using **Python, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas** to extract product information from a sample webpage and save it into a structured CSV file. 📄🔍 

**What This Project Does:** 
✅ Fetches webpage content using `requests` 
✅ Parses and extracts product names, prices, and stock availability with `BeautifulSoup` 
✅ Cleans and structures the data 
✅ Saves it into a CSV file for further analysis 

**Technologies Used:** 
🟢 Python 
🟢 Requests 
🟢 BeautifulSoup (bs4) 
🟢 Pandas 

 **Installation & Usage:** 
Simply install the required libraries: 
```bash 
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas 
Run the script, and it will generate products.csv, storing extracted product data.
